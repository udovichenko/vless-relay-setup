## How It Works

![Architecture](./docs/architecture.svg)

The relay node provides network segmentation: clients connect to the nearest server while internet traffic exits through a remote one.

![Comparison: single-hop vs multi-hop](./docs/vpn_relay_comparison.svg)

This architecture provides:

- **Resilience** — if the exit node goes down, replace it in one place; clients won't notice
- **Segmentation** — separating entry and exit points means metadata is split across hops
- **Low latency** — clients connect to the geographically closest server

### SelfSteal SNI (optional)

SelfSteal mode aligns your server's domain, IP, and TLS certificate for consistent transport configuration. Caddy serves a real website on your domain, eliminating SNI/IP mismatch.

![SelfSteal comparison](./docs/selfsteal-comparison.svg)

SelfSteal is fully optional — just press Enter during setup to skip it. When enabled, Caddy also reverse-proxies the management panel and subscriptions.

![SelfSteal architecture](./docs/selfsteal-architecture.svg)

### CDN Fallback (optional)

Traffic is routed through Cloudflare CDN, providing an alternative delivery path when direct connectivity is unavailable.

![CDN comparison](./docs/cdn-comparison.svg)

CDN Fallback supports two modes. Asymmetric sends outbound traffic through CDN while inbound goes direct (faster). Symmetric routes everything through CDN (maximum resilience). Both profiles are available via subscription.

![CDN architecture](./docs/cdn-architecture.svg)

CDN Fallback requires SelfSteal (needs Caddy) and a separate domain connected to Cloudflare. Cloudflare setup is manual (instructions are shown during installation).

### Direct Exit (automatic)

Direct connection to the exit server without passing through the relay. Single hop instead of two — minimal latency. The link is automatically added to the subscription with the lowest priority: the client uses it only when relay and CDN are unavailable.

```
Subscription (priority order):
  ① Relay → Exit          primary
  ② CDN Asymmetric        fallback (fast)
  ③ CDN Symmetric         fallback (resilient)
  ④ Hysteria 2            UDP channel (Salamander + port hopping)
  ⑤ Direct Exit           fastest, but less reliable
```

### Hysteria 2 (optional)

UDP channel using the Hysteria 2 protocol. Runs over QUIC with Salamander obfuscation (traffic is indistinguishable from random data) and port hopping (client switches between ports every few seconds). Resilient to UDP blocking — no fixed port and no identifiable QUIC headers.

Requires SelfSteal (needs TLS certificate). Link is added to subscription automatically. Hysteria 2 runs as a separate process alongside XRAY — two channels are fully independent.

### DNS Filtering

The exit node uses AdGuard DNS to filter ads and trackers at the DNS level. No client-side configuration needed.

### Features

- **VLESS + XTLS-Reality + XHTTP** — end-to-end TLS 1.3 encryption with XHTTP transport on both hops
- **Multi-tier CDN Fallback** — backup routes through Cloudflare with asymmetric mode
- **Adaptive connection protection** — packet padding and connection multiplexing
- **Hysteria 2 (UDP)** — fallback channel with Salamander obfuscation and port hopping
- **3X-UI panel** — web interface for user management, traffic limits, and monitoring
- **Subscriptions** — automatic configuration updates on client devices
- **SSH hardening + fail2ban + UFW** — automated server security configuration
- **Backup / Rollback** — automatic backups on every update with rollback on failure

## Prerequisites

- **2 VPS servers** running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (minimum 1 CPU, 512 MB RAM)
  - Relay — nearest server to your clients for minimal latency
  - Exit — remote server (different region or country)
- **SSH keys** configured for both servers (the script disables password login)
- **Domain** (optional) — for subscriptions and/or SelfSteal mode
- **CDN Fallback domain** (optional) — separate domain connected to Cloudflare (free plan). Requires SelfSteal

> **Important:** SSH keys must be configured before running the scripts.

## Preparation

### SSH Keys

```bash
# 1. Generate a key (if you don't have one)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519

# 2. Copy the key to the server (repeat for each)
ssh-copy-id root@<server-IP>
```

After this, `ssh root@<IP>` should work without a password.

### Domain (optional)

If you plan to use SelfSteal, configure DNS A records **before** running the scripts:

| Record | Purpose | Points to |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `exit.example.com` | SelfSteal on exit node | Exit server IP |
| `example.com` | SelfSteal on relay node (main domain) | Relay server IP |
| `panel.example.com` | Management panel via Caddy | Relay server IP |
| `sub.example.com` | Subscriptions via Caddy | Relay server IP |

Without SelfSteal — a single A record pointing to the relay is sufficient for subscriptions.

## Installation

![Installation flow](./docs/installation-flow.svg)

> Always start with the exit server — the relay needs its connection details.

### Step 1. Exit Server

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y git
git clone https://github.com/nozikov/vless-relay-setup.git && cd vless-relay-setup
chmod +x scripts/*.sh scripts/lib/*.sh
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh exit
```

> **Re-running:** if exit is already set up, the script will suggest `update-exit`. Use `--force` to reinstall. Use `--skip-ssh` to skip SSH hardening.

The script will prompt for settings:

```
3X-UI panel port [34821]:              ← Enter for random port
3X-UI panel secret path [a8Kx...]:     ← Enter for random path
Admin username [admin]:                ← admin username
Admin password:                        ← password (hidden)
Custom SSH port (Enter for default 22): ← SSH port
Domain for SelfSteal SNI (Enter to skip): ← domain or Enter
```

With SelfSteal enabled, the script will also install Caddy, issue an SSL certificate, and offer a choice of site content. It will also ask about CDN Fallback:

```
CDN domain for Cloudflare (Enter to skip): ← CDN domain or Enter
Hysteria 2 UDP port (Enter to skip):      ← Hysteria 2 port or Enter
```

If a CDN domain is provided, the script configures a CDN route through Caddy. Cloudflare setup instructions are shown at the end. Hysteria 2 is installed as a separate process alongside XRAY (UDP, port hopping + Salamander).

The script outputs connection parameters at the end — **save them** for relay setup:

```
  Exit server IP:       185.x.x.x
  Exit UUID:            a1b2c3d4-...
  Exit Reality pubkey:  AbCdEfGh...
  Exit Reality shortId: 1a2b3c4d
  Exit Reality SNI:     exit.example.com
  Exit XHTTP path:     xK9mP2vL
```

These values are also saved to `/root/exit-server-info.txt`.

### Step 2. Relay Server

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y git
git clone https://github.com/nozikov/vless-relay-setup.git && cd vless-relay-setup
chmod +x scripts/*.sh scripts/lib/*.sh
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh relay
```

> **Re-running:** `--force` to reinstall (regenerates all keys). `--skip-ssh` to skip SSH hardening.

The script will ask for exit server parameters (from step 1), then panel settings and (optionally) SelfSteal:

```
Exit server IP:                ← from step 1
Exit server UUID:              ← from step 1
...
Domain for SelfSteal SNI (Enter to skip): ← domain or Enter
```

With SelfSteal enabled, additionally:

```
Domain for 3X-UI panel (e.g. panel.example.com): ← subdomain for panel
Domain for subscriptions (Enter to skip):        ← subdomain for subscriptions
```

Without SelfSteal — the script will only ask for a subscription domain (optional).

### Step 3. Add Users

Open the relay panel: `https://<relay-ip>:<port>/<path>/`

1. **Inbounds** → find your inbound → **+ Add Client**
2. Set email (name), traffic limits, and expiration
3. Copy the subscription link for the user

### Step 4. Client Setup

Share the subscription link with the user. In the app: **Subscriptions → Add → Update → Connect**.

## Project Structure

![Project structure](./docs/project-structure.svg)

## Management

### Updating Configuration

```bash
cd ~/vless-relay-setup && git pull

# Exit server
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh update-exit

# Relay server
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh update-relay
```

Keys, UUIDs, clients, and statistics are **preserved**. Only the configuration template is updated. A backup is created before each update with automatic rollback on failure.

With CDN Fallback, `update-relay` automatically syncs the CDN link with the current exit UUID. If the exit UUID changes — just run `update-relay`, and subscriptions will update. Users only need to refresh the subscription in their app.

To update binaries (XRAY, 3X-UI, Caddy), add `--upgrade`:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh update-exit --upgrade
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh update-relay --upgrade
```

### Uninstalling

```bash
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh uninstall           # with confirmation
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh uninstall --force    # without confirmation
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh uninstall --purge-certs  # also remove SSL certificates
```

SSH keys and `sshd_config` are never removed — server access is preserved.

### Services

```bash
# Exit server
systemctl restart xray && systemctl status xray
journalctl -u xray -f

# Relay server
x-ui restart && x-ui status
x-ui log
```

ls -la /var/log/vpn-setup-*.log
cat "$(ls -t /var/log/vpn-setup-*.log | head -1)"
```

**Can't connect:**
```bash
# Exit
systemctl status xray
journalctl -u xray --no-pager -n 50

# Relay
x-ui status
x-ui log
```

**Panel not accessible:**
```bash
x-ui status
ufw status
```

**Lost exit server credentials:**
```bash
cat /root/exit-server-info.txt
```

**HTTP 500 when adding a client:**
```bash
# Check xray template in 3X-UI
sqlite3 /etc/x-ui/x-ui.db "SELECT value FROM settings WHERE key='xrayTemplateConfig';" | jq '.api'
# If null — run update to restore the template:
sudo ./scripts/setup.sh update-relay
```
